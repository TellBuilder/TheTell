Defining The Tell
  
  Communicating a message is like painting a picture in the imagination of the recipient.  If the person receiving the message understands the communication they will have a clear view of the imaginary artwork. The message sender cannot be sure if the message was delivered until the recipient responds.  The original message sender receives confirmation if response resembles the original intent. If the original sender changes the response into a third image, the new image would be the combination of different ideas into one image.
  
  
Viewing The Tell

Communication and language are the primary tools used to paint mental pictures and the internet is the canvas that the whole world can see so a website will be created to allow others to view the growth of The Tell. The website will include instructions to allow others to build and improve the process.
